#Personal React Book Library

A WIP prototype of a book library app, meant to store information about books I own & read as well as parse any relevant data I can think of.

Built with React, Redux, SASS, and too many node packages.

This readme is WIP and will be updated more thoroughly as the project develops.

##To get started
I don't know why you'd want to right now since it's an unstyled and completely basic CRUD app, but you'll need to set up another folder outside the client and configure a [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to save data. This will change in the future.

##Latest features
0.1.0

```
Stable functionality for all books:
-Create
-Edit
-Delete
-Display
-Compare
-Sort
-Filter

QoL improvements:
-Filter function now recyclable
-Bookshelf refactored to no longer contain its own logic
-Can now sort by date read

```

##Work In Progress

You can view the tasks & basic features I'm currently working on and hope to bring in to future patches/updates in the [to-do list](/todo.md).
