*** Short term ***
------------------
-Toggle read vs unread
-Have unread books contain a different class w/ conditionally rendered values
    (Date read, rating, awards)

*** Medium term ***
-------------------
-Implement genres as a tagging system
    -In progress - tags component works but doesn't communicate with Redux
-Datepicker
-5 stars rating system

*** Long term ***
-----------------
-Styling
-Have suggested tags?
-Figure out the best way to do book covers


*** Issues ***
--------------

---BookFormRedux
#01 Reset Form Values properly BookFormRedux (line 31)
#02 InputTag component doesn't work with BookFormRedux (lines 69 - 79)
#03 RenderGenreInput doesn't validate properly in the validate function (lines 82 - 107 && 153)
#04 Uncheese onSubmit (110-113). Related to problem 1

---InputTag
#01 Need to pass in the input & spit out the values
#02 Figure out how to store all tags & all genres
#03 RemoveTag in current implementation is incompatible with reordering tags

---GenerateGenreMasterlist
#01 Buggy & causes 500 error (due to data structuring)
