*** Short term ***
------------------
-Have unread books contain a different class w/ conditionally rendered values
    (Date read, rating, awards)
-Add ability to sort by date read
    -Validate/normalize date inputs
-Separate out get visible books & sort books


*** Medium term ***
-------------------
-Datepicker
-5 stars rating system
-Add statistics page
-Switch genre & format bookshelf from dropdown to input with dropdown
-Write github readme & format properly
-Consolidate library & bookshelf components
-Add filter to bookshelf component
-Figure out where to put "Generate master list" for genres (and eventually other kinds of tags?)
    -Maybe app init?
    -In which case, set up a landing page + simulate a "log in"
-Add "Awards" (actually this is just tags) ((actually maybe it isn't))
    -Maybe separate out into "Best of" category that has more strict validation (i.e. there can be only one Gold Medal 2018)
    -Style awards and tags
-Bookshelf needs to be refactored so it doesn't contain any of its own logic and instead just outputs the proper results

*** Long term ***
-----------------
-Styling
    -(Break this down into medium priority tasks)
-Have suggested tags?
-Figure out the best way to do book covers
    -This might be how we end up on Firebase
-Implement tagging system
    -In progress - tags component works but doesn't communicate with Redux
-Clean up Redux/API calls/the app so it only fetches what it needs, not *EVERYTHING*
    -https://www.apollographql.com/ (SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS WHAT I NEED)
-"You should read next"
-Profiles??
-Add notes


*** Bugs/Issues ***
--------------

---BookFormRedux
#01 Reset Form Values properly BookFormRedux (line 31)
#02 InputTag component doesn't work with BookFormRedux (lines 69 - 79)
#03 RenderGenreInput doesn't validate properly in the validate function (lines 82 - 107 && 153)
#04 Uncheese onSubmit (110-113). Related to problem 1

---InputTag
#01 Need to pass in the input & spit out the values
#02 Figure out how to store all tags & all genres
#03 RemoveTag in current implementation is incompatible with reordering tags

---GenerateGenreMasterlist
#01 Buggy & causes 500 error (due to data structuring??)

*** Dream ***
-----------------
Barcode scanner integration for books?
Google Books API?
